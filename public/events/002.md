The Team has travelled up into the Insol Coast, and met up with several important people in town. 
This includes: Wilson Zhu, their Ranger Liason
Cassandra Micheals, the Ranger Technical and Wildlife Analyst


Allan Relov, who handles the Printer in town as well as boat repair

George R. Paige, who runs Big Dick's Subs and Deli

The Team has then, during one of their patrols, ran into one of these fishing vessels, only for Bonnie to be shot at and knocked off balance while the ship escapes mysteriously. 

A patrol a few days later leads into their first combat sortie. Weird tracks into forest reveal a mirage from a group named __THE HANDS THAT REACH DEEP__ that was jumping and piloting a bunch of older dredged hardware remotely.
