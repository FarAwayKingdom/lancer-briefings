# Mission // #001
## Sightseeing Spring Scavengers

Ranger Zhu has informed the team that Capo Sincere has had some mysterious unit dredging out in the bay. Little to nothing is known about them, though they have chassis. The woods and cliffs around here are no longer safe, and securing them is the job of Lancer Team Romeo-Echo-Echo-Lima. Discovering information of them is also a top priority. Engage at opportunity, and figure out what is going on here and end it.
Patrols start in the AM.

# Goals
- Defend the bay of Capo Sincere
- Patrol local beaches and forests around the bay
- Figure out who exactly you are fighting

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, Capo Sincere will not trust the party, and the mysterious force will have tempo and advantage over the area.

# Reserves
- None at this time. Available ones include some from Capo Sincere, Ranger Zhu, or buried waiting in the local countryside.
