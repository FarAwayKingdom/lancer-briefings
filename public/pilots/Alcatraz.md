Yeah the prisoner thing went well. Met a man who's a great mix of loyal and gifted with explosives, and they had him in a cell till they needed an ablebodied militia. We picked him up for a few. He's great to have in both the most open of drug runner decks and the confined corridors of subline smuggler vessels, keep him on call for Operation Temperant Swing. - IPS-N Security Chief Yeshin


Worked with IPS-N Trunk Security and local law enforcement in operation 'Rock and Hard Placeâ€™. IPS-N Sec-Chief Yeshin remarked on his usefulness to the militia, and poised for his release into IPS-N custody/employment program: Chains-To-Plowshares
